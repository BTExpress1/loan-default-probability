## ðŸ““ Project Notebooks

This project is structured into three main notebooks, each serving a distinct role in the pipeline:

1. **Notebook 1 â€” Data Wrangling & EDA**
   - Load LendingClub dataset (2.4GB raw â†’ sampled for EDA).  
   - Cleaned and reduced features (145 â†’ 117 â†’ 80 â†’ 54).  
   - Explored target distribution and probability views.  
   - Saved final feature set (`columns_to_keep.txt`) for reproducibility.

2. **Notebook 2 â€” Preprocessing & Baseline Modeling**
   - Apply encoding (categorical â†’ one-hot/label).  
   - Apply scaling (Robust/Standard for skewed numerics).  
   - Train baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
   - Evaluate using ROC-AUC, LogLoss, precision/recall curves.  
   - Address class imbalance with class weights/resampling.  

3. **Notebook 3 â€” Tuning, Calibration & Business Insights**
   - Hyperparameter optimization with cross-validation.  
   - Model calibration (e.g., isotonic) to improve probability estimates.  
   - Feature importance with SHAP values.  
   - Business-facing outputs: threshold scenarios, KS statistic cutoffs.  
   - Generate interpretable insights for HR/compliance teams.

ðŸ“Œ **Tip:** Run the notebooks in order (1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3). Artifacts from one notebook (cleaned data, selected features, saved models) feed into the next for full reproducibility.
